Welcome to the official overview of the STRIDE XAI framework. STRIDE was invented and developed by **Chaeyun Ko** as part of a Master's thesis at Ewha Womans University.

## üí° Core Idea & Vision

Confronted with the 2^d complexity wall in XAI, I challenged the established view that enumeration was necessary. STRIDE is the answer to a fundamental question‚Äî"Can we decompose a model's logic without brute force?"‚Äîand embodies my philosophy of turning deep theoretical inquiry into tangible, real-world impact.

- **New Paradigm**: Moves beyond combinatorial methods by using **Orthogonal Decomposition in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)**.
- **Key Innovation**: Analytically separates a model's output into main effects and high-order interaction effects, revealing **how** features interact, not just **what** features are important.

## üöÄ Key Results & Capabilities

- **Performance**: Achieved **up to 9.7x speedup** over TreeSHAP on benchmark datasets. 
- **Fidelity**: Reconstructs original model predictions with **high fidelity (avg. R¬≤ > 0.93)**.
- **Validation**: Validated through a **first-author ICLR 2026 submission**, a **pending patent**, and a **Letter of Intent (LOI)** from a leading fintech CTO.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Source Code

- **Languages**: Python (Proficient), MATLAB
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

The core algorithms of STRIDE are proprietary and patent-pending. This repository serves as a portfolio demonstrating the project's methodology, results, and the engineering quality of non-proprietary components (e.g., visualization, benchmarking). The full source code is maintained privately, and I would be happy to discuss the architecture and implementation details in an interview.
